Pacemaker, Corosync and the Distributed Replicated Block Device can be used
to create a highly available solution where two MySQL Fabric instances working
in active and stand-by mode are configured.

The "examples/ocf/mysql-fabric" script is used by the Pacemaker component to
manage the MySQL Fabric instances and should be deployed as follows:

    cp examples/ocf/mysql-fabric /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/.
    chmod 755 /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/mysql-fabric

Scripts to coordinate the other components are already available when Pacemaker
is installed. Details on how the different components are orchestrated can be
found elsewhere.
